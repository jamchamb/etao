etao is a simple Python library that assists in the creation
of cryptanalysis tools. It takes care of common low-level tasks
such as converting letters to numeric values or splitting a buffer
into a bit stream or series of fixed-size blocks, as well as higher-level
things like frequency analysis.

Installation
------------
Install with pip::

    pip install etao

As of version 1.0.0 this library switched from Python 2 to Python 3; for
Python 2 use version 0.6.0.

Example Application
-------------------
The following is a Caesar cipher solving tool that uses etao's frequency
analysis functions and built-in ciphers.

.. code:: python

 #!/usr/bin/env python
 # Caesar cipher solver
 import argparse
 from etao import CaesarCipher, NgramFrequencyScorer
 from etao.freq import ENGLISH_DIGRAMS


 def main():
     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Caesar cipher solver")
     parser.add_argument('ciphertext', type=str, help='text to decipher')
     args = parser.parse_args()

     scorer = NgramFrequencyScorer(freq=ENGLISH_DIGRAMS)

     # Get every Caesar shift of the ciphertext
     shifts = [CaesarCipher(n).decrypt(args.ciphertext) for n in range(26)]

     # Score each shift according to English character frequency.
     # Get tuples that pair the score with the text.
     scored_shifts = [(scorer.score(shift), shift) for shift in shifts]

     # Sort by score, descending order
     scored_shifts.sort(reverse=True)

     # Print the top 3 results
     for result in scored_shifts[0:3]:
         print('"%s" (%02d%%)' % (result[1], int(result[0] * 100)))


 if __name__ == "__main__":
     main()

Here's what it looks like in action:
